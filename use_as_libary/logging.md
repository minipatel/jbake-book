# Logging

All output is generated using LogBack apart from certain elements of the command line interface. You can control the output by making sure there is a logback.xml
on the classpath. The binary distribution includes a pre-defined [logback.xml](https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/blob/master/src/main/logging/logback.xml) that is
a good reference point.
