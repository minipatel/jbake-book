# Data Model

A data model is exposed to each of the templates (regardless of what template engine you use) allowing you to get access to the data parsed from within
the content files, the model can also be used to apply logic to the output from the templates.

* [Global](global.md)
* [Page / Post / Custom](page__post__custom.md)
