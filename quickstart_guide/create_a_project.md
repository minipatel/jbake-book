# Create a Project


To get up and running quickly with JBake you can use it's example project structure along with sample templates as a starting point for you project or site. To do so
first you will need to create a new directory and change into it:


    $ mkdir project
    $ cd project


Then you can use JBake to initialise this directory with it's example project structure and templates by executing the following command:


    $ jbake -i


NOTE: This will use [Freemarker](http://freemarker.org) templates by default, see the <<usage>> section on how to specify the template engine you prefer.
