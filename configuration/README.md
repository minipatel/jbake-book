# Configuration


The `jbake.properties` file (or legacy file custom.properties) allows you to customise the configuration of JBake for your project.
For example you can change the name of the folder that stores your content or templates, decide whether to generate a
RSS feed or not. The following sections detail the complete list of configuration options available to you. JBake ships
with a default configuration file ([default.properties](https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/blob/master/src/main/resources/default.properties))
that defines the defaults for these options however you can choose to override these by defining options in your `jbake.properties` file.

So in the absence of these options in your jbake.properties the default value provided by JBake will be used.

You can also comment out any configuration options by adding a hash or number sign as the first character on a line in your file.
