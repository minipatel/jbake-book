# GVM

You can also install JBake via [GVM](http://gvmtool.net) (Groovy enVironment Manager) if you are running a Bash based platform (Mac OSX, Unix, Linux, Cygwin or Solaris etc.).
GVM will take care of downloading the latest distribution, installing it and configuring your environment for you.


After you have GVM installed enter the following command to install the latest version of JBake:


    $ gvm install jbake
